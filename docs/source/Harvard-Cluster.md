The R720, eosctl01, connects to sw1 over em1-em4, and to sw3 over p3p1 (p3p2 is disconnceted).  The 16 blades connect to sw1 over p3p1 and to sw3 over em1 (em2 and p3p1 are disconnected).

[[How To Test Harvard Moc Cluster]]

# Overview

This document is a description of the MOC OpenStack cluster configuration being hosted at Harvard.

This infrastructure will serve to support MOC development and production purposes. It is being done using puppet and other automation technologies so that it can be reproduced in VMs or on other nodes.

## How do I get in?

We have a VM (on eos-ctl01), moc-ssh-gateway, that you can SSH to, at ``140.247.152.200``.  (You can get an account on this machine if you contact us.  Please note that we are ONLY allowing public key authentication.)  From there you can reach the Openstack dashboard at ``140.247.152.207``.

### Psst... I want to get at internals that shouldn't be exposed to the public internet!

There is a second VM, moc-ssh-backdoor, that is on both the public network and the private network, located at ``140.247.152.201``.  You can reach it if you're on moc-ssh-gateway.  This machine should generally not be on!  You can ask for an account on this machine, but unless you have a really good reason, you're not going to get one.

## Redhat Contacts

* dcritch@redhat.com - David Critch
* jjozwiak@redhat.com - Jon Jozwaik

## Nodes

We have a Dell R720 with 12 TB of storage, and 16 Dell M620 smaller blades.  The R720 is running a large number of VMs for various purposes:
* Red Hat Satellite (controls and deploys most other nodes)
* 3 Ceph nodes (storage; managed by but not deployed by Satellite)
* Calamari (manages Ceph; managed by but not deployed by Satellite)
* Rados (Gateway for Ceph, implementing Swift (and Cinder?) interfaces; deployed with Satellite)
* SSH Gateway
* ELK-stack (elastic search, logstash, kabana, for logging and searching logs)
* Sensu (for monitoring)

Physical node roles include:
* One OpenStack controller, hosting management for: Nova, Neutron, (others?)
* 15 OpenStack compute nodes

16 nodes total, hence the 16 Dell M620 blade servers. 

Second cluster set up:

We carved out 4 compute nodes, computer12 to computer15 for a second Openstack deployment - without Ceph. The remaining twelve compute nodes remain as part of the existing cluster with Openstack and Ceph deployment described in the [Redhat Engagement Journal](MOC OpenStack_Ceph_Satellite Engagement Journal - November 2014_v1.2.pdf). More details on this second cluster is in the **Dev Cluster** section below. 

## Networks

This configuration differs from many production deployments in that we won't be
using separate physical NICs to host each data type (storage, management,
user), and are instead multiplexing those streams using 802.1Q (except for
production management traffic). Because of this, there is a little extra
complication in setting everything up discussed later.

Each node has 2 NICs that we will be using:
* A 1G interface, running in access mode. This will be used for accessing Satellite, PXE, and for the production cluster, management traffic.
* A 10G interface, running in 802.1Q mode. This will house traffic for: storage (VLAN 600) and tenant networks (VLANs 100-599). For non-production clusters, this will also host management traffic (dubious---discuss.  We can't deploy Openstack with Satellite onto a node with only one nic).

OpenStack will use native VLANs for user networks. This shouldn't be a
limitation in the near-term as Harvard has allocated 501 to the MOC.


# Configuring

Because we have only one machine with storage, we are not running Swift.  Instead, we provisioned 3 Ceph VM on the R720 (managed by a VM running Calamari), and are using Rados in front of it to provide Swift (and Cinder?).

## Networking

First, we need to configure the tagged interfaces. In the future, this should
be handled by puppet on top of the OVS switch. To do this manually, we need to
log into the node and:

1. Disable network manager. "systemctl disable NetworkManager"
1. Enable network. "systemctl enable network"
1. Configure our tagged interfaces.
 * In /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts, create a new file for the tagged network. ie- "ifcfg-br-ex.1000"

```
TYPE=Ethernet  
BOOTPROTO=static  
DEVICE=br-ex.1000  
NAME=br-ex.1000  
ONBOOT=yes  
IPADDR=...  
NETMASK=...  
MTU=9000  
```

## Dev Cluster
* We want a dev environment, where we can potentially split the 16 node cluster into 2, 8-node portions

* In the separate dev environment
 * We'll put the management network on a separate 10G VLAN.
 * Separate all services into separate IP address ranges to prevent any potential conflict with the production.
 * The 1 IP we need to route to is the meta-controller.
 * We won't use the 1GB interface on the dev env except to boot into PXE

To configure a dev cluster:
1. Through Satellite, clone the puppet config
1. Change the IPs
1. Change the interfaces. Every network should be tagged, since it's on the 10G
 * Configure the interfaces such that 10G has a bridge to VLAN 2444.
 * Need to assign a static IP.

## Host names
Everything is under the moc.rc.fas.harvard.edu subdomain. You must be VPN'd in to access this subdomain.

###Machines: 
1. The R720 head machine, running vms is at eos-ctl01.rc.fas.harvard.edu - 10.31.27.200
1. The controller is controller.rc.fas.harvard.edu - 10.31.27.207
1. The compute nodes follow the convention of compute01.rc.fas.harvard.edu, with 01 substituted by the number
1. The switch that we have access to is at mghpcc-rc-2-c-5-sw3 - 10.31.29.126, username mocadmin

###OBMs:
1. the r720 obm is at eos-ctl01-obm.rc.fas.harvard.edu
1. chassis cmc is chassis2c051-cmc-obm.rc.fas.harvard.edu
1. blade obmâ€™s are holy-nova2c05101-obm.rc.fas.harvard.edu .. up to 16 for last 2 digits

###VMs:
1. Satellite is at moc-sat.rc.fas.harvard.edu - 10.31.27.201
1. MOC-logstash is at 10.31.27.152
1. Moc-sensu-centOS is at 10.31.27.157

## Current issues
* Need to puppetize ceph and calamari deployment, have to manually deploy before installing nodes atm
* SSL currently disabled (we think just Horizon uses)... didn't have an SSL cert to supply
* Had to manually create SSL certs on control for both horizon and AMQ
* Puppet is overriding a rabbitmq parameter that is setting SSL use as true, because it is missing a parameter in this version. As a temporary workaround we will run puppet appy on the nodes, then disable puppet, and set this parameter as true in the related files through sed. The command is listed in Jon's doc
* Sensu is set up, but actually doing anything. See [[Things to monitor with Sensu]]

## Boot NICs

Satellite keeps resetting the mac address of nodes to the wrong value -- to re-provision you need to first correct the mac address. Here's a list of the ones we've collected manually (by booting the machine and watching the console):

```
B8:2A:72:4F:A3:E1 - compute12
B8:2A:72:4F:A3:FB - compute14
```

If a machine isn't in this list, please add it once you've found the mac the hard way.

Note that we *hope* this is solved for the future (see the ops log), but it's too early to say.
