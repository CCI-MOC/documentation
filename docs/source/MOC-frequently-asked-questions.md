Every time I spin up a new instance of ubuntu I am unable to connect to the internet without editing `/etc/resolv.config` and setting `nameservers 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4`. 

Put the DNS nameservers as specified in below links when creating/updating the private-network.

Unable to ssh/ping to my instance from outside world even though I have floating-ip assigned to it

Edit security-groups and allow ssh/ping to your instance. Unless you do that, you can't access those ports on your instance from outside.
