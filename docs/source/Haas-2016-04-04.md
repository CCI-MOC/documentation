PR Wrangler for this week: Kristi

## Priorities:
* Getting 0.2 released
* Setting up haas beta

## Setting up PRB status:
* Servers have been cabled and assigned to haas environments
* TP-link was configured so that nodes like moc{1,2} can join networks
* FreeIPA is configured and running
* beta haas server OS is installed.

## Still need to:
* Set up MOC intranet with Internet access (another ipfire)
* set up ssh gateway
* Ravi needs an iSCSI target
* Kristi’s logging PR: getting username from flask. Will need to keep in mind that when we switch to keystone, we’ll need to see if this still works
* Orran brought up having vector operations in the API
* Ravi will bring google doc updates to beta haas with existing NEU script.
* Discussion about notifying users when a node’s lease expires. Part of 0
* Talk to Laura about BIOS upgrades for Sun blades to see if they support lanplus/IPMI 2.0
* Need to document that haas should be the only thing managing VLANs; external changes should not be done. Each port should be owned by a single haas. Could we place a comment on the switch as a mutex?
* talk to Laura about BIOS upgrades for Sun blades to see if they support lanplus/IPMI 2.0

Discussed v0.3 planning priorities. Added a bunch of stuff to v1.0 and v0.3 that will need to be winnowed down.
