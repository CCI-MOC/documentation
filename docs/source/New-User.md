# Getting Started Guide For New Users

Welcome to the team! This document is a checklist of things you should
do to get up to speed.

# Getting Access To Infrastructure

We use various online tools as part of our process. Make sure you're set
up with them:

* Make sure you have accounts on [Github][1], [Bitbucket][2] and
  [Trello][3] and email kaizen@lists.massopen.cloud about
  being added to the organization and the right teams.
* Get on our mailing lists. There are two of them, both on [Google Groups][4]:
  * moc-technical, which we use for technical discussions. This is a public
    mailing list which anyone can join without approval (including you,
    so go sign up!)
  * moc-developers, which is private -- you can use the same interface
    to request to be added to the group, and someone will have to
    approve you.
* We have an IRC channel, #moc on freenode. You should be hanging out in
  there whenever you're working. If you don't already have an IRC client
  you prefer, we recommend [Pidgin][5] for Linux and Windows, and
  [Adium][6] for Mac OS X.
* Get an ssh public key to one of the sysadmins, which you will use to log
  in to our servers.

# Getting Acquainted With our Development Process:

The [moc-public][7] repository on our Github provides some additional
documentation of interest, in particular there is a document about our
development [workflow][8].
