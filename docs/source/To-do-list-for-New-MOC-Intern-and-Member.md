### Team calendars
We use Google calendars as a collaboration tool. We have the following calendars:

  **MOC** administrative

  **MOC - Activities** team-wide activities and meetings

  **MOC - Engineers** MOC engineers and embedded engineers' office hours, OpenStack meetings that engineers attend on regular basis, etc.

  **MOC - Interns**  interns/students' hours working as part of the MOC.

Please share your the time slots when you plan to spend time in the MOC and/or on the MOC related projects. Send a request to msd@bu.edu to be added to the appropriate calendar.

### Get familiar with OpenStack, github, Python and Red Hat Enterprise software

  **OpenStack** : There are many tutorials online for OpenStack. Going over the official [getting start guide](http://docs.openstack.org/admin-guide-cloud/content/ch_getting-started-with-openstack.html) can be helpful. The MOC team tutorial on how to use our production system can be found at [Getting started wiki] (Getting-started.html)

  **Python** : You may want to consider using [iPython](http://ipython.org/) or other interactive Python tool to learn to code in Python. Similar to OpenStack, there are quite a few online tutorials. The [official Python](https://www.python.org/) site is here.

  **github** : If you are not already familiar with github, you can start at its [official site](https://github.com/) for the "how-to".


### MOC Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA)
Contributors to the MOC are required to sign the [Individual Contributor Agreement](https://massopen.cloud/blog/individual-contributor-license-agreement/). Send Jennifer Stacy (jstacy@bu.edu) a quick note when you are done with this step. Note that you will not be allowed to contribute to any code base unless you sign the agreement.

### Team Communication

  **Standup** : the MOC team is an Agile team. Twice a week, Tues. and Thur., we have standup in the MOC team room. Face-to-face communication is best. However, if you cannot attend in person, you can dial in

    > Phone: 866-715-6499

    > Guest: 675-377-3302

    > TYPE-IN-RANDOM-NUMBER-FOLLOWED-BY-#

  **Team Slack room** : For private team conversation, a good alternative channel of communication is the [massopencloud.slack.com](https://massopencloud.slack.com/). If you don't have a slack account, go to [slack.com](https://slack.com) and create one. If you do have a slack account already, you can access the **massopencloud** room as you wish. Contact msd@bu.edu if you have any problem.

  **MOC team email mailing list** : Go to the following the following URL to subscribe yourself to the MOC [team mailing list](https://mail.massopen.cloud/mailman/listinfo/team)

Contact msd@bu.edu if you have any question/problem.

### MOC Community
We want everyone that has a strong engagement with the MOC to be visible to and engaged with our users. The goal is to keep the time commitment modest and spread across the entire team of developers, postdocs, visiting scientists, faculty and students, while maintaining a high level of service to Kaizen users.   

What we are asking each MOCer is to take on one day of the help desk per month.  That is, you will be responsible for answering questions that come to the ticketing system for one day (as well as any follow up). 

The expectation isnâ€™t that you a-priori know an answer, but that a smart person with insider access to the project team can quickly figure out an answer, put together a response and where it makes sense expand on our FAQ list.

To be part of the MOC community and participate in the help desk/ticketing system:
* send an email to admin@lists.massopen.cloud and ask to be added to both the signup sheet for the helpdesk and the MOC ticketing system.
* signup for your help desk coverage [here](http://www.signupgenius.com/go/5080444aca622abff2-help)
* subscribe to the [kaizen mailing list](https://mail.massopen.cloud/mailman/listinfo/kaizen)

This mailing list is where you can ask the experts or share your knowledge in anything related to the MOC infrastructure including but not limited to OpenStack, Ceph and general networking topology in our production Kaizen.

For part-time interns, i.e., those that work 10-15 hours a week, this task is optional. You are encouraged to volunteer if this activity will not interfere with your class schedule.

You can expect at most a couple of questions in a day, and likely less. If you get more than that, then contact admin@lists.massopen.cloud and we will get you more help. We think this will be a great learning experience for everyone, and help increase the engagements across the team.

### Special Interest Mailing
