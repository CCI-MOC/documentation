## OpenStack Dashboard Overview

   * When you log in you will be taken to the Compute panel which is under the Project tab.
   * In the top bar you can see the two tabs in small print: Project and Identity.
   * Beneath that in larger print are the three panels: Compute, Network, Object Store.
   * On the Compute panel you see an overview of different resources.
