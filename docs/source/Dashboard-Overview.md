# OpenStack Dashboard Overview

When you log in you will be taken to the Compute panel which is under the Project tab.

In the top bar you can see the two tabs in small print: Project and Identity.

Beneath that in larger print are the three panels: Compute, Network, Object Store.

On the Compute panel you see an overview of different resources.

### Compute Panel

Navigate: Project -> Compute -> Overview

Take some time to click through the different tabs under compute, such as Instances. 

### Network Panel

Navigate: Project -> Network -> Network Topology   

Next click on the Network panel.  You should see the external public network which has already been created.
