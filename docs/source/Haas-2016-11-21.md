* Revert_port request. Need to connect two ports to the brocade switch: 1 to an end node (could be a sun or supermicro), another with tagged VLANs for management (VLAN 1) and data. (Naved)

* Give Kyle access to a real machine. Talk to Gerardo about len-60. (Jason)

* VPN as a service: for now (until HIL's API stabilizes), the team agrees that we should merge this in as an extension under the ext/ folder. That way, we can hook it into the deployment tests and folks will realize if they break it!
