* Kyle is the PR Wrangler for this week
* This sprint will go for 2 weeks
* Sahil will run a status check-in next Tuesday, as Monday is a holiday and Jason will be out next week

# Priorities

* Getting 0.2 released
* Completing PRB cluster
* Narrowing down the 0.3 release (Jason + Peter)

# Upcoming items

* Have an alembic youtube-watching tutorial time this week (Jason will plan)
* Discuss auth semantics for network ACLs (George + Jason + Kyle after meeting)
 * Completed. "Creator" field will change to "Owner". `show_network` will also show connected 

* Kyle & Ron need to merge their show_switch
* Kyle will organize a meeting with SESA group to discuss the design of vector operations. Transactional vector operations likely not in scope for 0.3, since the performance gains wouldn't have a major impact yet on current systems.

# Beta environment

* Sahil had network issues because FreeIPA was down. Jason thinks he knows why and it's fixed now.
* Jason + Sahil need to get the deployment server online again after network movements
  * 2 PRs need deployment tests
* Kristi + Kyle need access to the dev + deployment server (Jason)
