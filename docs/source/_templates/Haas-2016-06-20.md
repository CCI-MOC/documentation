PR Wrangler: Nick (by his choice)

# Announcements

* Starting 2 weeks ago, HIL team switched to 2-week sprints.

* Everyone is encouraged to grab [0.2 issues](https://github.com/CCI-MOC/haas/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3Av0.2) and work on them. These are smaller, bite-sized tasks that are perfect for beginners and experienced folks and improve the overall quality of HIL.

# Priorities

* Support NSDI submission in September

* Fixing 0.2 issues

* Figuring out VPN architecture while we have Ron

* BMI group would like to upgrade NEU HIL master

# Other notes

* Ron will send email to Jethro, Peter + rest of the group to meet this week about VPN

* Nick will grab items from the [0.2 issues](https://github.com/CCI-MOC/haas/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3Av0.2) list. Everyone is encouraged to follow his lead!

* Need meeting with BMI folks to find out when they'll need an updated HIL install. The problem is that database migrations don't work that far back. Options include: nuking the current DB and re-creating needed projects/configs or trying to manually migrate the DB.


* Jethro is taking on Kyle's revert_port() + ACL work
