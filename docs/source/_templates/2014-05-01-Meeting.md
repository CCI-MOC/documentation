# Administravia
## Hardware donations
* SGI hardware: we are receiving 320 nodes in 4 racks soon
 * It might be easier for SGI to donate to MGHPCC instead of directly to a university
* Dell is donating 16 high end nodes and lots of storage

## Network
* To cable all this hardware, we need 32, 10Gb ports + 2-4 uplinks to NEU core switches

# Development

## HaaS
* Primarily Ian - there's a paper being worked on which is driving deploying HaaS onto the MRI hardware.
 * Chris has provided some MRI nodes for us to prototype with
* Zhaoling and Ian have been working on the new API
 * Openstack requires multiple VLANs per port.
 * This is becoming a blocking item

## Openstack
* Preparing for the openstack technical talk has been going on
* Orran would like to see a whitepaper on our requirements for openstack prior to the full fledged paper
