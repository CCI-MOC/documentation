* PR 680 (node metadata) waiting on Jason for design input. Since these are REST interface questions, it might be good to get input from Kristi.

* Naved will organize a meeting so we can come up with a strategy for switch consistency. A couple of things to keep in mind:
  * We could maintain metadata on the switch, and check it sometimes (#687)
  * We could write the switch config to the switch every time we make changes (#688)
  * Could copy the running config to the HIL DB on every network operation. This brings up the question of who manages the switch config: the admin directly or HIL.
  * There are going to be uplink ports that are **not** managed by HIL
