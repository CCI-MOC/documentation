Abbreviated meeting due to shorter week/Jason's outage.

* The build was breaking, likely due to parallel sqlite testing. [[github issue](https://github.com/CCI-MOC/haas/issues/577)] [[temporary workaround pull request](https://github.com/CCI-MOC/haas/pull/578)].
* Sahil is working to write bash scripts to register the nodes being managed
* Sahil is also looking for experienced reviewer input on his client library
* Kyle is blocked getting DB migrations working. She will set up a hacking session next week for us all to become acquainted with how to do DB changes.

# OpenVPN service

We discussed the OpenVPN investigation happening with Jethro and Ron. Sounds like using OpenVPN in "bridged" mode is a good way to go. OpenVPN also supports a static client/server config (Version 1), but it sounds like that is L3/routing, and wouldn't transport DHCP requests.

Whatever API we come up with should support a scalable implementation.

Interesting point was made that if there were a single process handling everything, it could cause issues like:
* Bottlenecking network bandwidth due to being a single process/thread
* Risking a configuration issue giving access to unauthorized networks
* Distinct processes can be created/killed easily, vs a monolithic daemon
