Transitioning from Django to AngularJS
=============

Overview
--------
This write-up is made for quickly let you understand AngularJS and able to participate in the development of Horizon in Openstack by using AngularJS.

Prerequisite
-------
Since AngularJS is actually a javascript library, you should know how to use JavaScript before you start the development.  A great source to learn javascript is through http://www.w3schools.com/js/ . 

Besides the basic javascript syntax you should also understand the list of feature of javascript:
- Function Hoisting
- Callback Pattern
- Module Pattern
- Static Members

Leanring Curve
-------
Although AngularJS web app is entirely client-side application, but you can write AngularJS application without intergrating with a back end at all and still have a dynamic, responsive web app. 
It is learning curve is steeper than normal front-end technique. 

Write-up Structure
-------
Since this write-up aims to quickly let you know how to develop AngularJS with openstack, I will skip the detail of JavaScript and AngularJS (maybe I will create an independent pages for tutorial). 
But now let's install a devstack environment and testify the AngularJS portion. The write-up will follow this structure:
- Boot A VM in Cloud
- Install and initial devstack on the VM
- Running the devstack and be able to play with the dashboard
- Using Django to add a function to the dashboard 
- Instead of Django, using AngularJS to achieve that functionality
