* Jason is the PR Wrangler

* Merged logging

* Sahil has a temporary fix for the node_register bug. It sounds like lots of people are hitting it and can't register nodes due to this.

* Ron & Jethro: looking at VPN credential management mechanisms.
  * Generating random static keys on the server would be simple and work for everyone.
  * Could later implement certificates for those desiring that functionality.
  * OpenVPN software seems to indicate that they don't like static keys (they're just for development).
  * 

* Serial console: need to implement deployment test covering serial console output so it doesn't break again. Fix for current code scheduled for v0.3.

* Kyle: needs help doing DB migrations. We will have an alembic exploration time on Tuesday, 12:30-2pm.
  * Would still like to get feedback. Only the DB tests are failing
May2
* Ravi & Sahil will exchange MAC address info for PRB beta env

  * Jason, Orran & Sahil will discuss design ideas
