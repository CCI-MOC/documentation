# OpenStack FAQ
FAQ for OpenStack instance e.g. why network on my instance does not work ?

*  Q:  I have launched an Ubuntu instance but I am not able to ssh into the system. I have tried on Windows and Ubuntu host OSs, but I am getting the "Connection Timed Out" error. 

   A: For accessing the instances from outside world, you need to make sure you have followed these steps:-
1. Your public ssh-key selected (in access and security section) while launching the instance so that you can use it to ssh to the instance.
2. Assign floating-ip to the instance in order to access it from outside world.
3. Make sure you have added rules in the security-groups to allow ssh to the instance.

A common issue is to not using a floating-ip to access the instance. You can associate a floating-ip to the instance by clicking "assign floating ip" and then clicking the "+" icon to allocate one if its not available.
