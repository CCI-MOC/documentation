## Background:
   To get access the Cloud Computing environment - we have OpenStack running on our infrastructure, you would need to have your ssh keys installed. Talk to TA or refer to BlackBoard on the same.

Once you have followed instructions on this page you should have the credentials to access the OpenStack dashboard form your browser.

## System Requirements:
## Operating System tested:
* MacOSX - tested 
* Linux any flavor - steps should be similar
* Windows - preferably use an Ubuntu VM or talk to TA

## Checklist
Ensure that you have completed the following steps:
* Your ssh key is emailed to Jason Hennessey: henn_at_bu_dot_edu .
* Upon providing your ssh key, you can login to the ssh-gateway (necessary steps will be explained later) using your bu username.
* You will also be given a password to login to OpenStack.
